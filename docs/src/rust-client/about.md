# Rust Client

Rust library, which can be used to programmatically interact with the Miden rollup.

The Miden Rust client can be used for a variety of things, including:

- Deploying, testing, and creating transactions to interact with accounts and notes on Miden.
- Storing the state of accounts and notes locally.
- Generating and submitting proofs of transactions.

This section of the docs is an overview of the different things one can achieve using the Rust client, and how to implement them.

Keep in mind that both the Rust client and the documentation are works-in-progress!
