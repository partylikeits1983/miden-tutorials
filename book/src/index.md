# Introduction

This repository contains concrete, basic tutorials and examples of how to build applications on Miden. The goal is to make getting up to speed with building on Miden as quick and simple as possible.

All of the tutorials are accompanied by code examples in Rust and TypeScript, which can be found in the [Miden Tutorials](https://github.com/0xPolygonMiden/miden-tutorials) repository.


The tutorials repository is separated into four main parts:
1. **masm** directory – Contains Miden assembly code used in the tutorials.
2. **node** directory - Contains the necessary config files for running the miden-node locally.
3. **rust-client** directory – Contains examples of using the Miden Rust client.
4. **web-client** directory – Contains examples of using the Miden web client in the browser.
